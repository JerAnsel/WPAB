            <p>AACI, a voluntary, non-profit organization, was established in 1951 to help North American immigrants acclimate to Israeli society and to build strong ties between North American Jewish communities and Israel. Today, AACI’s services are available to all English speakers. AACI is governed by a lay board and administered by a professional staff. Its many activities are financed through the support of foundations, annual membership dues, an annual fundraising drive and private donations.</p>

                AACI Children and Teen Arts Exhibit 
                Supported by the Betsy Sugarman ז"ל Memorial Fund 
                AACI has been presenting WITH BRUSH AND PEN Children and Teens Arts Exhibit in our Jerusalem office annually since 2011, except for 2020 when it was cancelled due to the COVID pandemic.  We estimate that over the years approximately 2500 young artists and writers have participated in the project.  We are proud of the fact that children from all parts of Israel have participated including from minority communities. There are no religious or ethnic requirements for submitting work to WITH BRUSH AND PEN.  all children and teens living in Israel are invited to submit work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BRUSH part of WB&P relates to the plastic arts - painting, drawing, collage, mosaic, sculpture, etc.- while the PEN section includes creative writing in English - short stories, poems, and non-fiction. 
            </p>
            <p>NEW THIS YEAR – 2021!</p>
            <p>
                Due to the continuing limitations of the COVID pandemic we decided to put WITH BRUSH AND PEN on the internet for the first time!  This is an exciting step for us and enables many more people to view the work created by young people in Israel.
                This ambitious undertaking is supported by a generous grant from the Betsy Sugarman ז"ל Memorial Fund.

                Betsy Sugarman z"l was an AACI volunteer for many years.  She was one of the founders of JELLY, the Jerusalem English Language Library for Youth, which has made English-language literature available to Jerusalem school children.  JELLY now supports a teachers' resource center and KIDSREAD, an annual reading-writing project. Because of Betsy's love of children and education, WITH BRUSH AND PEN is dedicated to her memory.
