        Hi, my name is Winter Acid Blood Rain or Winnie for short. I was born on a dark and stormy night, which is how I got my name. It suits me well, my name is cold, dark and mysterious like my aura. I am a witch and today is the first day of my seventh year at Hogwarts. Ugh, I hate this school. So many nerds shuffle around the halls living dreadfully meaningless lives every day.        I hate everybody except for a few friends of mine. 
        <br><br>
        When I get on the train on platform nine and three quarters I immediately look for them. After a few minutes of walking with my head down so my long black hair covers my face, I finally reach the last compartment that seems somehow darker than the others. The door emits black steam, but the air around it is freezing cold. I smile a small smile, there’s no way this coach isn’t theirs.   I slide the door open and to my horror the people I find in the carriage aren’t my friends, but James Potter and his minions!!!
        <br><br>
        They’re sitting inside with black cloaks that droop over their faces like harbingers of death. They have put many hematite stones in a circle to create the lingering cooling effect, and each of them holds black candles with very long wicks, which are making the black smoke. Why have they lured me here? I panic.
        <br><br>
        James turns to me and smiles. “Oh goody, we’ve caught us a nice evil Slyther-Slug.” 
        <br><br>
        The rest of his gang laughs as I continue to stay rooted in my seat. Suddenly James stands up and lifts his wand before me. “Locomotor Wibbly!” he yells, and just as his hand swishes and flicks, someone hauls me over and presses me toward the back of the train, causing James’s jinx to miss me. 
        <br><br>
        My savior has let go of me and I lift my head to look up right into his dark gloomy eyes that glimmer with pain. It’s Severus Snape, the guy I have been crushing on since the first day of Hogwarts when I saw him being sorted into Slytherin, just like me.
        <br><br>
        “You shan’t engage with them,” Severus says in his deep goth voice.
        <br><br>
        I slowly feel my cheeks burning up. “I-” I manage to say before he turns around to James, who’s standing in the hallway.
        <br><br>
        Severus takes out his wand and points it at James. “Leave, you don’t want to mess with me, boy!”
        <br><br>
        James scoffs and slinks back to his compartment, slamming the door shut. 
        <br><br>
        “Thank you!” I finally manage to blurt out.
        <br><br>
        “You don’t go to this school to freeze and do nothing when danger’s near y’know,” he says and turns to me.
        <br><br>
        I lower my head shyly; I’ve never been more embarrassed in my entire life!
        <br><br>
        “What is your name, girl?” he asks me.
        <br><br>
        “Winter,” I say.
        <br><br>
        “Like the darkest most mysterious and coldest season of the year,” he mutters, looking me up and down. “I’m Severus,” he says coldly and walks away. 
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        The next day when we enter the Great Hall I can see everyone’s eyes turn to fixate on me as I walk shyly to my table. When I sit down I am immediately approached by three Slytherin guys, asking me what they can bring me for breakfast. 
        <br><br>
        “Maybe some Boo Berry Cereal with unicorn blood,” I smile confidently at them, and immediately they get up and bring me a bowl. I eat a bit, but not too much because I’m anorexic and I don’t like eating because I don’t conform to society’s norms of eating a lot. 
        <br><br>
        “You’re anna too?” a deep dark voice says behind me. I turn around to see Severus Snape standing there behind me. He is so much cuter up close! He’s wearing a black T-shirt with a high neckline and a picture of a big skull, with black baggy jeans. His black hair covers half of his face. His eyes glimmer with pain and sorrow and are traced with black eyeliner, and he has a new lip ring. The guys surrounding me back off the moment they see him, because they know how strong he is and they’re scared. 
        <br><br>
        “Yeah,” I say. 
        <br><br>
        “Because why conform to society’s excessive eating standards when you can still live without eating?” we say in unison.
        <br><br>
        I giggle and tuck my long black tresses behind my pierced ears with multiple silver earrings, some shaped like skulls.
        <br><br>
        Abruptly, Lucious Malfoy stands up and walks over to us. “Back off Severus, she doesn’t want you.” He’s wearing a long black leather trench coat and his hair is long, platinum blond and slicked back. He has a nose ring and two lip rings below his lips. His pants are also leather. He is wearing a lot of eyeliner. He is super-hot, but I know he’s bad business.
        <br><br>
        Severus turns to him and looks him right in the eyes, “Beat it, Malfoy, she’s mine.”
        <br><br>
        Then Lucious punches him in the face, almost knocking him over. Severus lifts his foot and kicks him with his checkered shoe. Malfoy yells in pain and recoils.
        <br><br>
        “I’ll get you back for this, you pathetic loser!” and he scrams out of the Great Hall. 
        <br><br>
        All the students start to cheer for Severus, and the teachers stare at him, stunned.
        <br><br>
        “Severus, that was really brave of you,” I say, impressed with his fighting skills.
        <br><br>
        “Call me Sev,” he replies, and goes to class.
        <br><br>
        ***
        <br><br>
        When I get out of class later that day, I see Sev in the hallway waiting for me.
        <br><br>
        “Hey,” I say shyly as I walk towards him.
        <br><br>
        “Hey,” he says back and fiddles with his black nail-polished fingers. “I was wondering…”
        <br><br>
        My heart stops. Is he going to ask me on a date?!
        <br><br>
        “Would you like to meet up with Lily and me after school?”
        <br><br>
        My heart sinks. I was hoping he’d ask me out, or at least suggest meeting alone with him, but instead of saying what I’m thinking, I crack half a smile and say, “Sure! I’d love to.”
        <br><br>
        Sev smiles at me. “Okay, see you later!” he says happily and walks away.
        <br><br>
