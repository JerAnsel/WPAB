		<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Corona Blues </h3>
		When the unknown hits and you end up at home
        sitting in your room when it's dark, all alone.
        <br><br><br>

        Slowly drifting away, far from society
        not talking to friends, filling with anxiety.
        <br><br><br>

        Your first thought being “this can't last too long”
        but then the virus announces “this is where I belong”!
        <br><br><br>

        Thus begins online schooling
        but fellow students, who really are we fooling?
        <br><br><br>

        With the dark and black squares
        hiding our blank and dull glares
        <br><br><br>

        So here we are, not truly learning 
        and the amounts of homework leave our eyes burning. 
        <br><br><br>

        We try and convince ourselves that the end is so near
        but the constant death tolls are all that we hear.
        <br><br><br>

        So what's left to do is look up to the sky
        smile and sigh 
        telling each other don't let this life just pass you by.
        <br><br><br>

        When the unknown hits and you end up at home
        sitting in your room when it's dark, all alone.
        <br><br><br>
