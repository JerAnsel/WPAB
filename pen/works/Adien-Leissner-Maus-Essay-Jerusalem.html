		<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Maus Essay </h3>
		Maus is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman. Maus is by far one of the best books I have ever read and also the book that taught me the most about the Holocaust. I have read it several times and notice new details every time I read it.  I have been so inspired from this book that I wanted to draw a piece based on this book. Through drawing, I wanted to show what (in my opinion) the story is about. While drawing and sketching, I got to think about these subjects, and how to show them through the picture.<br><br> 
        First we must understand that the story is more than just a Holocaust book. If it was, the story would go something like this: Art comes in to see his father, Vladek. Art talks to Vladek about his book and Vladek tells his story. As we can see, the story did not go in that direction. In the book, we see not only Vladek's story, but we see Art's story too. He uses the book not only to tell his father's story, but to project his thoughts and feelings about his father, his relationship with him, being a son of a Holocaust survivor and about the book itself. In a way, we get to see his story too. <br><br>
        The way I wanted to reflect all these things in the picture is by showing the stories of both Art and Vladek. We see in the bottom of the page Art and his father, sitting and talking, and from each side, is shown their story, and a figure in the middle. This figure represents both of these characters. When I first drew him, I thought he was Vladek, however, the more I looked at him the more I realized that he doesn’t look like him but more like a mouse that was stuck in Auschwitz.  I used him anyway, because he represented for me someone who went through Auschwitz, a survivor. I wanted him to represent both of the survivors in the story, one of the being the holocaust survivor, and the other being the second generation, the one that went through their parents trauma. This is why the book is called: MAUS: A SURVIVORS TALE. <br><br>
        More than that, the book in my opinion also talks about relationships, between a father and son, between a husband and wife, both Art and Francoise, Vladek and Anja and Vladek and Mala, and I focused on these relationships when I chose which pictures for my piece. I focus most on the relationship between Vladek and Anje because that is the main "story" in the book – it begins with how they meet and ends with them being reunited in the afterlife. <br><br>
        I don’t want to write more about the picture because in art like in literature, we have to leave room for the interpretation of the viewer or the reader. I just want to say something about the Magen David in the sphere in the center of the piece – on the cover of the book is a swastika with Hitler (as a cat) in the middle. I wanted to emphasize the victory of the Jews so I drew the symbol of my people with a (Jew) mouse in the center instead. I am very pleased to have finally put onto paper all these thoughts that have been going round my head since I first picked up this book.
