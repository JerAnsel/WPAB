		<h3 style="text-align: center;"> The Red Cobra </h3>
		Let me start by introducing myself.  My name is Roni, short for Veronica.  I'm petite, with long red hair, always flopping into my eyes.  I live in a small town called Cherry Blossom, Virginia.  Our town is known for having cherry trees everywhere.
        <br><br>
        My life changed completely on the morning of my sixteenth birthday, June 1st.  It was a lazy Saturday morning, and all the trees were in bloom.  I had planned a Sweet Sixteen birthday lunch with my family and friends at a nearby sushi restaurant.  It was already 9:30, time to wake my parents so we could go decorate the restaurant with balloons and signs.  I entered their room - my mom wasn't there, but my dad was lying across the bed.  He and the twisted sheets were covered with blood.  I couldn’t stop screaming. My mom rushed upstairs, and immediately called the police.
        <br><br>
        After they examined Dad, the policemen said it looked like he had committed suicide.  I couldn't believe them. First of all, he was a guy who loved life, and he’d left no suicide note. Secondly, the evening before, he had whispered in my ear, "Tomorrow I'll give you the best gift ever."  Since when is killing yourself a good present for your child?!  My father, Richard, would never do such a thing, that's for sure. Thirdly, Dad had just bought himself a pair of limited edition SpongeBob Nike Kyrie basketball shoes. There was no way he was going to commit suicide and leave those babies behind!    
        <br><br>
        Of course, I couldn't argue with the police.  They were in a hurry to close Dad's case and go on to the next one.  Sure enough, two weeks later, another gruesome homicide took place, with many similar details.  From that day forward, there were more and more murders in our peaceful little town. Every week or so, someone would get murdered, and no one had a clue as to why or who was killing them.  After my dad was killed, the other victims had the same telltale signs:  blood all over them and the sheets, but the police didn't think Dad was part of the serial murders.  They gave the killer a nickname, "The Red Cobra," because the perpetrator was sneaky, and the victims had been dyed red in their own blood.
        <br><br>
        Now, a year after the death of my father, my mom has become an alcoholic, so she completely forgot my seventeenth birthday.  The only one who remembered it was my best friend, Nate.  He wasn't just my buddy – because I was an only child, he was closer, like a brother.  I knew I could confide in him.  I could trust him with my life.  
        <br><br>
        Nate was kind of a cool guy, tall and thin, with dark brown hair and blue eyes. That morning, he came to pick me up for school in a new jeep.  It belonged to his dad, Derek, who sometimes let him drive it around town.  Nate told me he wanted to bake me a birthday cake, but I refused his offer. Nowadays, I didn't really want to celebrate my birthday. At school, it was another uneventful day, which was odd, because my thoughts were totally in turmoil.   
        <br><br>
        That night, I woke up feeling very thirsty.  I went into the kitchen in the dark to get a glass of water.  Suddenly I stubbed my toe on something, and almost lost my balance.  I hit the light switch, and saw a piece of loose linoleum next to my foot.  Intrigued, I lifted it up and found a piece of paper scorched around the edges.  Then the door opened, and I instantly hid the paper underneath my shirt.  Mom came in and asked me what I was doing.  "Getting a cup of water," I said, and went straight to bed. I  had no idea what was written on the page. Certainly, I didn't want to read it alone.  I decided to wait and show it to Nate.
        <br><br>
        The next day, I went to Nate’s house and knocked on his door. He opened it, and we went upstairs to his room. Clutched in my hand was the piece of paper. “What is that?” he asked.
        <br><br>
        “It’s something I found, and thought we could read together.” Nate looked over my shoulder. We couldn’t believe what we were seeing:
        <br><br>
        My sweet little Veronica,
        I am writing you this letter because I am leaving. I know this is shocking and unexpected, but I am done with life. I realize it is your birthday tomorrow, but I’m tired of being with your mom. She is always pushing me and being hurtful. I’m sorry I didn’t buy you a birthday gift, but I just can’t go on. I’m sorry and goodbye.
        Love you, Richard
        <br><br>
        The note dropped out of my hand. Nate hugged me tightly. It was obvious that someone else had written it. Dad always called me Roni, never Veronica, and he had told me about the birthday gift he had already bought. Furthermore, why was the note signed Richard? He would have signed it Dad.
        <br><br>
        “Nate, who wrote this? And what do we do now?”
        <br><br>
        “Obviously, it was the killer. Why don’t we ask my dad if he has any ideas?” I nodded, and we headed downstairs to the kitchen, where we found Derek making an omelet.
        <br><br>
        “Hey guys, how are you?” Derek was always happy to see us. A smile lit up his freckled face. Nate and I looked at each other, and we both started to speak, but he stopped us. “Whoa, whoa, slow down. One at a time.” So instead of talking, we showed him the fake suicide letter. His face turned white; we thought he was going to faint. “Kids, I need to tell you something.”
        <br><br>
        Derek sat down at the table, and we sat beside him. He started describing what had taken place when he was in high school. My parents, friends of his, had had a one-night stand, and I was the result. It wasn’t supposed to happen. 
        <br><br>
        “Wait, you’re telling me I was a mistake?” 
        <br><br>
        “I’m sorry, Roni,” he sighed. We suddenly smelled something burning. Derek had forgotten the omelet on the stove. He got up and grabbed the frying pan.  
        <br><br>
        “So all this time, they didn’t want me? Were they lying to me the whole time?” I exclaimed.
        <br><br>
        “Your father was willing to do everything for you; he married your mom so that you would have a supportive family.”
        <br><br>
        “And my mother? What did she say about the marriage?” I asked him. Derek explained patiently, trying to find the right words.  He told me that my mother wasn’t liked at school, and that she was forced to marry my father by her parents.
        <br><br>
        “I want to know what happened to my dad and who killed him,” I demanded.
        <br><br>
        “And who wrote the suicide note?” asked Nate. “Did Richard have enemies? Hey, Dad, wasn’t there a school newspaper? Maybe it could give us some ideas.” 
        <br><br>
        “Yeah, let’s read about what happened in high school, and then we might be able to figure out the truth,” I suggested.
        <br><br>
        “Let me see what I can do,” answered Derek. He went down to the basement, and brought back a box filled with old newspapers and yearbooks. We started going through them, freshman year through senior year.
        <br><br>
        Suddenly Nate said, “Hey, I think I found something.” He showed us an article entitled, “Liz Pregnant with Richard’s Baby?!” At the end of the paragraph it said, “Although he has bullied her throughout the years of high school, she is being forced to marry him by her family.”  
        <br><br>
        We looked through a few more papers and found a photo, my mom and dad on their wedding day. She wore a bright red dress with a low back. My dad wore a black suit. I looked closely at the picture and saw that my mom, Liz, was wearing a gold snake bracelet.  “That’s weird, I believe the snake on her bracelet is a cobra,” I said.  
        <br><br>
        “Good eye, Roni,” Derek commented.
        <br><br>
        “Why is that important?” questioned Nate.
        <br><br>
        I opened my phone to search for articles about The Red Cobra murders. I showed them how all the murders had the same tell-tale signs of “The Red Cobra”. “See, all the other homicides resembled Dad’s murder. Derek, what can you tell me about all the victims?” He opened a yearbook from his senior year. All the victims were on the basketball team, and a picture was there, with this caption, “Richard Lewis, the captain, and his team holding the 1st place cup.”
        <br><br>
        “Dad, it said in one of the papers that Roni’s mother, Liz, was bullied by her classmates. Do you know exactly who bullied her?” asked Nate. 
        <br><br>
        “If I remember correctly, our basketball team started it, especially Richard, but we were kids in high school. It was a long time ago. I don’t think this would have affected us as adults.”
        <br><br>
        Nate jumped up. He started shouting, “You’re wrong, Dad! Think of who could’ve written the letter and left it in Roni’s house. Who wore a cobra bracelet, and who was forced into marrying her biggest bully?” Nate’s face had turned red. He was out of breath. Derek looked at his son, aghast.
        <br><br>
        I wrapped my arms around my body, and started rocking to and fro. Mom. Tell me it's not true. 
        <br><br>
        My phone was on the table. I dialed her number, and set the phone on loudspeaker. It began to ring. With every ring, I rocked faster. Someone answered. I heard breathing on the other end. “Hey, Roni, is everything okay?”  
        <br><br>
        “M-m-mom.” My teeth were chattering, I was so cold. I stumbled over my words:
        <br><br>
        “A-a-are y-you the Red Cobra?”
        <br><br>
